Run clickshare software in a docker container

Clone this git repo
go to this directory

run like so:

bash run.sh

then inside the container run:

./app/bin-amd64/clickshare

Current problem:

System tray shows, small window under it shows as well. The app says it's waiting for the button. I don't know why or how to fix it.

  Description     : Linux driver for ClickShare screen share system

We are considering to upload a non-free package with the ClickShare
driver for Linux into Debian.  The driver consist of two binary user
space programs and a udev rule to launch it when the dongle is inserted.
Based on the dependency list, we suspect it is sending snapshots of the
screen as a video stream to the TV or projector.
